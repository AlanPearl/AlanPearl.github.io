							<p><b>Research Interests</b></p>
							<p>
								I am interested in the galaxy-halo connection. This means I want to understand 
								what types of galaxies are likely to live inside of a dark matter halo with given 
								properties. We already know that there is a correlation between the mass of a galaxy 
								and the mass of its host halo. Additionally, recent evidence has pointed towards a 
								secondary correlation between the star formation rate of the galaxy and the mass 
								accretion rate of the halo. A more complete understanding of this relationship 
								would have profound implications on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
							</p>
								
							<p>
								My research aims to answer what types of galaxy surveys we need to be able to constrain 
								galaxy-halo connection models. Assuming a model, I generate samples of mock galaxies over 
								dark matter simulations. I then conduct mock surveys, and vary several parameters, such as 
								the area, depth, threshold, and completeness fraction of the survey. By comparing several 
								statistics from these mock observations, I can deduce which ones would be the most useful 
								to our goal of learning about the galaxy-halo connection.
							</p>
							
							<p><b>Research Projects</b></p>
 								<b>Created mock survey for PFS</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								Using UniverseMachine as a model and UltraVISTA photometry as training data, I created
								a mock galaxy catalog specifically tailored to making predictions for the upcoming
								PFS survey. This mock is publicly available 
								<a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/3mes7dipabo1mx06m4xdd5yaq0fr9461">here</a>.
