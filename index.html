            <h3><b>Thesis Overview</b></h3>
            <p>
                My goal is to improve our understanding of the galaxy-halo connection.
                This is broadly defined as learning what types of galaxies are likely to form inside
                a dark matter halo with given properties.
                This is an important statistical relationship to understand in order to compare
                our theory to observations,
                We already know that there is a correlation between the mass of a galaxy
                and the mass of its host halo.
                Additionally, recent evidence has pointed towards a
                secondary correlation between the star formation rate of the galaxy and the mass
                accretion rate of the halo.
                A more complete understanding of this relationship
                would have profound implications on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
            </p>

<!--                the area, depth, threshold, and completeness fraction of the survey. By comparing several-->

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                <b>Project I: Created mock survey for PFS</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Using UniverseMachine as a model and UltraVISTA photometry as training data, I created
                a mock galaxy catalog specifically tailored to making predictions for the upcoming
                PFS survey. Using this mock, I published a paper which demonstrated that future extensions
                of the PFS survey should prioritize increasing the survey area to best improve scientific
                goals. This mock is publicly available
                <a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/3mes7dipabo1mx06m4xdd5yaq0fr9461">here</a>.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                <b>Project II: Implementing differentiable HOD models</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The galaxy-halo connection is typically analyzed via Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
                sampling of parameter-space in order to place constraints on models. However, this process
                is greatly hampered by the stochastic nature of halo occupation distribution (HOD) models.
                Implementing a probabilistic and differentiable model will increase MCMC efficiency by
                several orders of magnitude, drastically broadening the possibilities of this analysis.
            </p>
